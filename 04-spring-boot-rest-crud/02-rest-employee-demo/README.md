1. put the configuration of the JPA/Hibernate in the application.properties
2. create the entity
3. create the DAO interface and implementation
4. create rest controller

remember entity managers are created by springboot automatically


THis project utilizes the standard JPA apis not JpaRepository, in the next one I'll be using it.
