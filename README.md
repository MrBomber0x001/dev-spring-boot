## Resources

main resources I depend on

- [Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 & Hibernate for Beginners - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial): A quick guide to start Spring boot, however it barely scratches the surface, some important concept of the Spring core concepts are skipped or not introduced at all, but overall good!
